Ts Timeline Project
Overview
This repository contains a project that is organized into three main folders: web, mobile, and server. Each folder represents a distinct component of the overall service, contributing to the modularity and maintainability of the project.

Project Structure
1. Web
The web folder encompasses the front-end component of the project. This is where you'll find the user interface, design elements, and client-side code. If you're looking to make changes to the visual aspects of the application or enhance the user experience, this is the place to focus your efforts.

2. Mobile
The mobile folder houses the mobile application part of the project. Here, you can find the code, assets, and configurations related to the mobile app. If you need to work on the mobile-specific features or adapt the application for different mobile platforms, this is the directory to explore.

3. Server
The server folder contains the server-side logic and functionality of the project. This is where you can find the backend code, APIs, and other server-related components. If your task involves handling data, managing user authentication, or making changes to the server logic, navigate to this folder.
